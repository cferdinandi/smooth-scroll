# License

Smooth Scroll has three types of licenses:

1. **[Open Source](#open-source-license)**, for personal and open source projects.
2. **[Commercial](#commercial-license)**, for commercial projects and applications.
3. **[OEM](#oem-license)**, for when this Smooth Scroll will be bundled with a commercial interface builder, SDK, or toolkit.

## Open Source License

If you're looking to use Smooth Scroll on an open source or personal project, the code is available under the [GPLv3 License](https://gomakethings.com/gpl/). GPLv3 has many terms, but the most important one is that it [requires you to license you entire project under the terms of GPLv3 as well](https://gomakethings.com/gpl/#5-conveying-modified-source-versions):

> You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.

You can absolutely use the open source license for commercial projects, but those projects must also be open sourced in their entirety with a GPLv3 license.

<hr>


## Commercial License

The Commercial License let's you use Smooth Scroll in commercial projects and applications without the provisions of GPLv3. With this license, your code is kept proprietary.

- You can use Smooth Scroll on as many websites or applications as you'd like.
- You can include it in your own commercial products and applications, such as premium CMS themes, plugins, or templates.
- Customers and users of your products do not need to purchase their own license, as long as they're not developing their own commercial products with Smooth Scroll.
