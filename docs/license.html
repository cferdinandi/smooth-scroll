<p>Smooth Scroll has three types of licenses:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="#open-source-license">Open Source</a></strong>, for personal and open source projects.</li>
<li><strong><a href="#commercial-license">Commercial</a></strong>, for commercial projects and applications.</li>
<li><strong><a href="#oem-license">OEM</a></strong>, for when this Smooth Scroll will be bundled with a commercial interface builder, SDK, or toolkit.</li>
</ol>
<hr>


<h2 id="open-source-license">Open Source License</h2>
<p>If you&#39;re looking to use Smooth Scroll on an open source or personal project, the code is available under the <a href="https://gomakethings.com/gpl/">GPLv3 License</a>. GPLv3 has many terms, but the most important one is that it <a href="https://gomakethings.com/gpl/#5-conveying-modified-source-versions">requires you to license you entire project under the terms of GPLv3 as well</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can absolutely use the open source license for commercial projects, but those projects must also be open sourced in their entirety with a GPLv3 license.</p>
<hr>


<h2 id="commercial-license">Commercial License</h2>
<p>The Commercial License let&#39;s you use Smooth Scroll in commercial projects and applications without the provisions of GPLv3. With this license, your code is kept proprietary.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use Smooth Scroll on as many websites or applications as you&#39;d like.</li>
<li>You can include it in your own commercial products and applications, such as premium CMS themes, plugins, or templates.</li>
<li>Customers and users of your products do not need to purchase their own license, as long as they&#39;re not developing their own commercial products with Smooth Scroll.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="buy-a-commercial-license">Buy a Commercial License</h3>
